# TSDoc Guidelines (JoinGo Frontend)

- Language: English for technical docs; UI copy stays in Spanish.
- Scope: Document exported functions, classes, hooks, and top-level helpers. Avoid commenting JSX-only render blocks unless they encapsulate logic.
- Structure:
  - Short description (what/why, not how).
  - `@param` for each parameter (include units or expected format when relevant).
  - `@returns` describing the resolved value; omit when `void` unless clarity is needed.
  - `@throws` for expected errors (e.g., network, validation, Firebase codes) when applicable.
  - `@remarks` for nuances (side effects, caching, retries, auth requirements).
  - `@example` only when usage is non-obvious (keep concise).
- Style:
  - Use imperative/concise tone: "Fetches", "Returns", "Starts".
  - Mention side effects: network calls, state mutations, token refresh, localStorage persistence.
  - Avoid repeating the function name; avoid implementation trivia.
- Firebase/Auth specifics:
  - Note when a function expects the user to be authenticated or will refresh tokens.
  - For password reset flows, state that links use `/reset-password` handler.
- WebRTC/Voice specifics:
  - Document callbacks, media permissions, and auto-retry behavior.
- Formatting:
  - Wrap identifiers in backticks when referenced in text.
  - Keep lines reasonably short; prefer one-blank-line separation between blocks.
